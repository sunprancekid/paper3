# paper3 - Self-Assembly of Colloidal Squares with Offset Dipoles under the Influence of an External Field
Programs used to generate and analyze data from molecular simulations for topic of third paper.

## Goal
My third paper focuses on applying a recently developed method of modeling an external field in DMD simulations (paper2). This research study explores the self-assembly of dipolar squares with an offset, embedded internal magnetic dipole. We developed models to explore the self-assembly squares in the absense of an external field (paper1). We found that the self-assembly of these squares depends on the location of the dipole embedded in the square and relative amounts of chiralities present in the system. In this study, we extend these insights to systems in which the external field is turned on to various strengths.
